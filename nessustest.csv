weaknesses.","The remote service accepts connections encrypted using SSL 2.0 and/or
SSL 3.0. These versions of SSL are affected by several cryptographic
flaws, including:

  - An insecure padding scheme with CBC ciphers.

  - Insecure session renegotiation and resumption schemes.

An attacker can exploit these flaws to conduct man-in-the-middle
attacks or to decrypt communications between the affected service and
clients.

Although SSL/TLS has a secure means for choosing the highest supported
version of the protocol (so that these versions will be used only if
the client or server support nothing better), many web browsers
implement this in an unsafe way that allows an attacker to downgrade
a connection (such as in POODLE). Therefore, it is recommended that
these protocols be disabled entirely.

NIST has determined that SSL 3.0 is no longer acceptable for secure
communications. As of the date of enforcement found in PCI DSS v3.1,
any version of SSL will not meet the PCI SSC's definition of 'strong
cryptography'.","Consult the application's documentation to disable SSL 2.0 and 3.0.

Many frameworks and languages treat 'HEAD' as a 'GET' request, albeit
one without any body in the response. If a security constraint was
set on 'GET' requests such that only 'authenticatedUsers' could
access GET requests for a particular servlet or resource, it would be
bypassed for the 'HEAD' version. This allowed unauthorized blind
submission of any privileged GET request.

for the authentication protocol.

When possible, Nessus tracks errors or failures related to otherwise
valid credentials in order to highlight issues that may result in
incomplete scan results or limited scan coverage. The types of issues
that are tracked include errors that indicate that the account used
for scanning did not have sufficient permissions for a particular
check, intermittent protocol failures which are unexpected after the
protocol has been negotiated successfully earlier in the scan, and
intermittent authentication failures which are unexpected after a
credential set has been accepted as valid earlier in the scan. This
plugin reports when none of the above issues have been logged during
the course of the scan for at least one authenticated protocol. See
plugin output for details, including protocol, port, and account.

Please note the following :

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for
  issues to be encountered for one protocol and not another.
  For example, authentication to the SSH service on the
  remote target may have consistently succeeded with no
  privilege errors encountered, while connections to the SMB
  service on the remote target may have failed
  intermittently.

- Resolving logged issues for all available authentication
  protocols may improve scan coverage, but the value of
  resolving each issue for a particular protocol may vary
  from target to target depending upon what data (if any) is
  gathered from the target via that protocol and what
  particular check failed. For example, consistently
  successful checks via SSH are more critical for Linux
  targets than for Windows targets, and likewise
  consistently successful checks via SMB are more critical
  for Windows targets than for Linux targets.","n/a","","Nessus was able to execute commands locally with sufficient privileges

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

Security Fix(es) :

* A flaw was found in the implementation of the 'fill buffer', a
mechanism used by modern CPUs when a cache-miss is made on L1 CPU
cache. If an attacker can generate a load operation that would create
a page fault, the execution will continue speculatively with incorrect
data from the fill buffer while the data is fetched from higher level
caches. This response time can be measured to infer data in the fill
buffer. (CVE-2018-12130)

* Modern Intel microprocessors implement hardware-level
micro-optimizations to improve the performance of writing data back to
CPU caches. The write operation is split into STA (STore Address) and
STD (STore Data) sub-operations. These sub-operations allow the
processor to hand-off address generation logic into these
sub-operations for optimized writes. Both of these sub-operations
write to a shared distributed processor structure called the
'processor store buffer'. As a result, an unprivileged attacker could
use this flaw to read private data resident within the CPU's processor
store buffer. (CVE-2018-12126)

* Microprocessors use a 'load port' subcomponent to perform load
operations from memory or IO. During a load operation, the load port
receives data from the memory or IO subsystem and then provides the
data to the CPU registers and operations in the CPU's pipelines.
Stale load operations results are stored in the 'load port' table
until overwritten by newer operations. Certain load-port operations
triggered by an attacker can be used to reveal data about previous
stale requests leaking data back to the attacker via a timing
side-channel. (CVE-2018-12127)

* Uncacheable memory on some microprocessors utilizing speculative
execution may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable
information disclosure via a side channel with local access.

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

Security Fix(es) :

* A flaw was found in the implementation of the 'fill buffer', a
mechanism used by modern CPUs when a cache-miss is made on L1 CPU
cache. If an attacker can generate a load operation that would create
a page fault, the execution will continue speculatively with incorrect
data from the fill buffer while the data is fetched from higher level
caches. This response time can be measured to infer data in the fill
buffer. (CVE-2018-12130)

* Modern Intel microprocessors implement hardware-level
micro-optimizations to improve the performance of writing data back to
CPU caches. The write operation is split into STA (STore Address) and
STD (STore Data) sub-operations. These sub-operations allow the
processor to hand-off address generation logic into these
sub-operations for optimized writes. Both of these sub-operations
write to a shared distributed processor structure called the
'processor store buffer'. As a result, an unprivileged attacker could
use this flaw to read private data resident within the CPU's processor
store buffer. (CVE-2018-12126)

* Microprocessors use a 'load port' subcomponent to perform load
operations from memory or IO. During a load operation, the load port
receives data from the memory or IO subsystem and then provides the
data to the CPU registers and operations in the CPU's pipelines.
Stale load operations results are stored in the 'load port' table
until overwritten by newer operations. Certain load-port operations
triggered by an attacker can be used to reveal data about previous
stale requests leaking data back to the attacker via a timing
side-channel. (CVE-2018-12127)

* Uncacheable memory on some microprocessors utilizing speculative
execution may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable
information disclosure via a side channel with local access.

mechanism used by modern CPUs when a cache-miss is made on L1 CPU
cache. If an attacker can generate a load operation that would create
a page fault, the execution will continue speculatively with incorrect
data from the fill buffer while the data is fetched from higher level
caches. This response time can be measured to infer data in the fill
buffer. (CVE-2018-12130)

* Modern Intel microprocessors implement hardware-level
micro-optimizations to improve the performance of writing data back to
CPU caches. The write operation is split into STA (STore Address) and
STD (STore Data) sub-operations. These sub-operations allow the
processor to hand-off address generation logic into these
sub-operations for optimized writes. Both of these sub-operations
write to a shared distributed processor structure called the
'processor store buffer'. As a result, an unprivileged attacker could
use this flaw to read private data resident within the CPU's processor
store buffer. (CVE-2018-12126)

* Microprocessors use a 'load port' subcomponent to perform load
operations from memory or IO. During a load operation, the load port
receives data from the memory or IO subsystem and then provides the
data to the CPU registers and operations in the CPU's pipelines.
Stale load operations results are stored in the 'load port' table
until overwritten by newer operations. Certain load-port operations
triggered by an attacker can be used to reveal data about previous
stale requests leaking data back to the attacker via a timing
side-channel. (CVE-2018-12127)

* Uncacheable memory on some microprocessors utilizing speculative
execution may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable
information disclosure via a side channel with local access.

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

Security Fix(es) :

* An integer overflow flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's
networking subsystem processed TCP Selective Acknowledgment (SACK)
segments. While processing SACK segments, the Linux kernel's socket
buffer (SKB) data structure becomes fragmented. Each fragment is about
TCP maximum segment size (MSS) bytes. To efficiently process SACK
blocks, the Linux kernel merges multiple fragmented SKBs into one,
potentially overflowing the variable holding the number of segments. A
remote attacker could use this flaw to crash the Linux kernel by
sending a crafted sequence of SACK segments on a TCP connection with
small value of TCP MSS, resulting in a denial of service (DoS).
(CVE-2019-11477)

an authentication protocol available on the remote target because it
was able to successfully authenticate directly to the remote target
using that authentication protocol at least once. Authentication was
successful because the authentication protocol service was available
remotely, the service was able to be identified, the authentication
protocol was able to be negotiated successfully, and a set of
credentials provided in the scan policy for that authentication
protocol was accepted by the remote service. See plugin output for
details, including protocol, port, and account.

Please note the following :

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for
  valid credentials to be provided for one protocol and not
  another. For example, authentication may succeed via SSH
  but fail via SMB, while no credentials were provided for
  an available SNMP service.

- Providing valid credentials for all available
  authentication protocols may improve scan coverage, but
  the value of successful authentication for a given
  protocol may vary from target to target depending upon
  what data (if any) is gathered from the target via that
  protocol. For example, successful authentication via SSH
  is more valuable for Linux targets than for Windows
  targets, and likewise successful authentication via SMB
  is more valuable for Windows targets than for Linux
  targets.","n/a","","Nessus was able to execute commands on localhost.
